- Implement supplied homepage screens as React presentation components using shared controls and scoped semantic tokens, keeping existing workspace routes intact; this preserves navigation and theme isolation.
- Workspace (/app) colours live under html.nova-ws / .nova-ws in src/styles.css and workspace data persists via src/lib/nova/workspace-store.tsx (localStorage); keeps public pages visually isolated and there is no backend yet.
